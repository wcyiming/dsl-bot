reply: Steam is a video game digital distribution service by Valve. 
It was launched as a standalone software client in September 2003 as a way for Valve to provide automatic updates for their games, and expanded to include games from third-party publishers. 
Steam has also expanded into an online web-based and mobile digital storefront. Steam offers digital rights management (DRM), server hosting, video streaming, and social networking services. It also provides the user with installation and automatic updating of games, and community features such as friends lists and groups, cloud storage, and in-game voice and chat functionality.

reply: The Epic Games Store is a digital video game storefront for Microsoft Windows and macOS, operated by Epic Games. 
It launched in December 2018 as both a website and a standalone launcher, of which the latter is required to download and play games. 
The storefront provides a basic catalog, friends list management, matchmaking, and other features. 
Epic Games has further plans to expand the feature set of the store front but it does not plan to add as many features as other digital distribution platforms, such as discussion boards or user reviews, instead using existing social media platforms to support these.

The service is provided across various platforms. Ubisoft Connect is used exclusively by first-party Ubisoft games, and although some third-party ones are sold through the Ubisoft store, they do not use the Ubisoft Connect platform.
